# Tap Titans Bot

## I Just Want To Use The Bot?

If you're here and you just want to download and run the application, look in the
[releases](https://github.com/becurrie/tap-titans-bot/releases) section of this repository for the .exe file that can be ran without setting
up a development environment. Note that your system will need to meet the requirements
below for the bot to work properly.

### Application Requirements

* Windows 10 (64 Bit)
* Windows Resolution Greater Than 480x800
* Supported Android Emulator (Nox/MEmu)

---

The following instructions are meant to help someone get the repository pulled
down and in a state where they can develop and run the application with Python instead
of using the bundled .exe file included in a release.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7

## Installation

* Pull repository into local folder.
* Create virtual environment to house all project dependencies.
* Install dependencies
* Run `application.py` from the main project folder.
